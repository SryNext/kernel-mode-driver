# cheat-driver

Simple WDM kernel mode driver for handling read/write memory requests into arbitrary processes.

## Background

Kernel based anti-cheat drivers (EAC, BattleEye) block or monitor requests for interfacing with the memory from the game process. The simplest way to bypass anti-cheat protections from the kernel is to use your own kernel mode driver.

## Building

1. Install Visual Studio.
2. Install the Windows Driver Kit.
3. Set the solution configuration to x64 and Release and build the solution.

## Usage

For practical use you will need a driver signing certificate. For development purposes you can enable test-signing mode.

You will need to either install and run the driver as a service with CreateService or use a function like NtLoadDriver. Once the driver is loaded, you can open a handle to the driver:

#include "driver_config.h"
#include "driver_codes.h"

HANDLE driver = CreateFileW(
    DRIVER_DEVICE_PATH, 
    GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE, 
    FILE_SHARE_READ | FILE_SHARE_WRITE, 
    0, 
    OPEN_EXISTING, 
    0, 0);

To issue read or write requests, you send the driver a control code:

DRIVER_COPY_MEMORY copy = {};
copy.ProcessId = processId;
copy.Source = sourceBufferPtr;
copy.Target = targetAddressPtr;
copy.Size = bytesToRead;
copy.Write = FALSE;

DeviceIoControl(
    driver, 
    IOCTL_DRIVER_COPY_MEMORY,
     &copy, 
     sizeof(copy), 
     &copy, 
     sizeof(copy),
     0, 0)

The target and source parameters should be reversed if issuing a write request.
